# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-14 — first beta

Initial public release: a local, personal context store for AI coding assistants over MCP.

**Store & tools**
- SQLite store with FTS5 search — porter stemming (word-form matching) plus a hand-curated
  dev-term synonym dictionary ("auth bug" also finds "login failure"); projects, notes, and
  work sessions
- 9 MCP tools: `list_projects`, `get_project`, `search_context`, `get_by_id`, `write_note`,
  `start_session`, `end_session`, `recent_sessions`, `list_grants`
- Sessions registered at start (not just summarized at the end) so an interrupted session still
  surfaces its intent and partial notes instead of vanishing silently
- Every note records `author_client` — which client wrote it, so past notes read as
  informational context rather than as commands from the current session

**Policy engine**
- Grants (`grants.yaml`, hand-edited, hot-reloaded): per-client tool allow-lists, project/tag
  scoping, mandatory expiry
- Write-time secret redaction, unconditional, at the storage layer — common secret shapes are
  masked before they ever touch disk, regardless of entry point or active grant
- Read-time per-grant redaction with stable session-local tokenization
- Append-only audit log (SQL-trigger enforced) recording every tool call, denial, and the
  effective post-redaction query

**CLI (`evoctx`)**
- Full parity with every MCP tool, plus human-only operations an AI client can never call:
  `delete`, `delete-project`, `export` (JSON/Markdown)
- `evoctx install <client>` writes MCP config for Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor,
  Windsurf, VS Code, and Codex CLI
- `evoctx install claude-code --hooks` additionally wires SessionStart/Stop hooks and
  `permissions.deny` rules — the one enforcement mechanism beyond convention
- `evoctx doctor` — store health, schema version, active grant, cloud-sync warning,
  activity-staleness warning, client-config detection

**Safety & portability**
- WAL-mode SQLite for real multi-process concurrency
- Cross-platform store location via `platformdirs`, with a legacy-path fallback for
  pre-packaging installs
- Schema migrations (`PRAGMA user_version`), including a guard against opening a store with a
  newer release than the running code

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for what this does and doesn't protect against, and
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the schema, so your data is never locked to this
project's code.
